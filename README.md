# telefonica-data-challenge

This project has been developed for Telef√≥nica's mobility data challange to optimize public transportation services across Spain. By analyzing factors like weather, special events, and recurring traffic patterns, we developed a predictive model to forecast mobility demand.

Key Features:
* Predictive Modeling: Combines mobility data with weather, holiday calendars, and day-of-week data.
* Demand Forecasting: Anticipates peak and off-peak periods for strategic fleet and schedule adjustments.
* Sustainability Focus: Reduces congestion and promotes efficient, sustainable public transport.
